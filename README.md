1)Mention the working of Internet Website in Terms of Front-end & Back-end Division?

The front end is the part of the website users can see and interact with such as the graphical user interface (GUI) and the command line including the design, navigating menus, texts, images, videos, etc. On the contrary, the backend is part of the website users cannot see and interact with.
The visual aspects of the website that can be seen and experienced by users are frontend. On the other hand, everything that happens in the background can be attributed to the backend. Languages used for the front end are HTML, CSS, and JavaScript while those used for the back end include Java, Ruby, Python, and .Net.
 The back-end is the portion of software that does not come in direct contact with the users. The parts and characteristics developed by backend designers are indirectly accessed by users through a front-end application.


2) What are tags in HTML? Explain each category of tag with an Example.
HTML tags are the keywords on a web page that define how your web browser must format and display your web page. Almost all tags contain two parts, an opening, and a closing tag.
There are two kinds of HTML tags: paired and unpaired. Some of the examples are
•	<a> for link
•	<b> to make bold text
o	<strong> for bold text with emphasis
•	<body> main HTML part
•	<br> for break
•	<div> it is a division or part of an HTML document
•	<h1>... for titles
•	<i> to make an italic text
•	<img> for images in the document
•	<ol> is an ordered list, <ul> for an unordered list
o	<li> is a list item in a bulleted (ordered list)
•	<p> for paragraph
•	<span> to style part of text

 3) Explain the working Procedure of Virtual DOM.
The virtual DOM provides a mechanism that abstracts manual DOM manipulations away from the developer, helping us to write more predictable code. It does so by comparing two render trees to determine exactly what has changed, only updating what is necessary on the actual DOM. The Virtual DOM avoids unnecessary updates and re-rendering of a web application user interface every time a change is made, hence making the web application fast and more efficient. The Virtual DOM improves a web application's user experience by reducing latency.

4) Mention some Differences between MySQL and No SQL
Some of the key differences between MySQL and NoSQL are discussed below-
First, MySQL is a relational database based on a tabular design. NoSQL is non-relational and has a document-based design.A MySQL database is currently more popular in the market than NoSQL because the latter is still fairly new. That means, at present, MySQL encompasses a large community while NoSQL has a comparatively small community while MySQL is not easily scalable due to rigid schema restrictions, NoSQL can easily be scaled because of its dynamic schema nature another key difference is MySQL requires a detailed database model before the creation of the database while NoSQL requires no detailed modelling .Also, unlike MySQL, which is a type of relational database, NoSQL is more design-based, with examples like CouchDB and MongoDB. Furthermore, NoSQL is much more flexible than MySQL.
One of the good things about MySQL is that it is available with a broad range of reporting tools that can help the validity of an application. On the other hand, NoSQL databases do not have reporting tools for performance testing and analysis.

5) Explain any one DBMS Technology in your own words.
NoSQL DBMS. Well-suited for loosely defined data structures that may evolve over time may require more application involvement for schema management. There are four types of NoSQL database systems: document databases, graph databases, key-value stores and wide-column stores 
Document databases store semi-structured data and descriptions of that data in document format, usually JavaScript Object Notation. They're useful for flexible schema requirements such as those common with content management and mobile applications. Popular document databases include MongoDB and Couchbase.
•	Graph databases organize data as nodes and relationships instead of tables or documents. Because it stores the relationship between nodes, the graph system can support richer representations of data relationships. The graph data model doesn't rely on a strict schema, and it can evolve over time.They  are useful for applications that map relationships, such as social media platforms, reservation systems or customer relationship management. Examples of popular graph databases include Neo4j and GraphDB.
•	Key-value stores are based on a simple data model that pairs a unique key with an associated value. Due to this simplicity, key-value stores can be used to develop highly scalable and performant applications such as those for session management and caching in web applications or for managing shopping cart details for online buyers. Examples of popular key-value databases include Redis and Memcached.
•	Column names and formatting can differ from row to row in a single table. Each column is also stored separately on the disk. As opposed to traditional row-orientated storage, a wide-column store is optimal when querying data by columns, such as in recommendation engines, catalogues, fraud detection and event logging. Cassandra and HBase are examples of wide-column stores.
